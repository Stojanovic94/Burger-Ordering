# Burger-Ordering
- PHP and CRUD Operations

## Overview
This project involves designing a simple web page with a form for ordering burgers. The web application will use PHP to interact with a database and HTML for displaying the form. It will implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations to allow users to order burgers, manage the orders, and store them in a database.

## Features
- **Burger Ordering Form:**
  - Users can select the type of burger, size, toppings, and quantity from the form.
  - Form inputs will be validated to ensure correct data submission.
  - After submitting the form, the data will be stored in a database for further processing.

- **CRUD Operations:**
  - **Create**: Allows users to place orders by inserting data into the database.
  - **Read**: Displays all existing orders in a table format for review and modification.
  - **Update**: Allows users to modify existing orders, such as changing the burger type, size, or toppings.
  - **Delete**: Provides an option to remove an order from the database.

- **Database Integration:**
  - A database will be created to store burger orders, with fields such as burger type, size, toppings, and quantity.
  - PHP will be used to perform CRUD operations on the database.

## Technologies Used
- **PHP** for handling form submissions and database operations.
- **MySQL** for storing and managing burger orders.
- **HTML/CSS** for designing the form and displaying orders in a user-friendly format.
- **JavaScript** (optional) for enhancing user interactions, such as form validation or dynamic updates.
